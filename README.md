#Tic-Tac-Dem
####By Reggie Kim

##Description
The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but with presidential candidates! Win three states in a row to win the game. Try to win because a tie only helps the leading candidate in the opposing party.

##Rules
1. First player is Bernie Sanders
1. Second player is Hillary Clinton
1. The two players alternate turns, capturing one state at at time
1. Successfully have three states in a row -- vertically, horizontally or diagonally -- to win
1. A full board with no winner will result in a tie
